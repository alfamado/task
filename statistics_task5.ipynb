    "## Chi-square test (for categorical data)\n",
    "```c\n",
    "The Chi-square test is a hypothesis test used to determine whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables. The chi-square test is a hypothesis test used for categorical variables with nominal or ordinal measurement scale. The chi-square test checks whether the frequencies occurring in the sample differ significantly from the frequencies one would expect. Thus, the observed frequencies are compared with the expected frequencies and their deviations are examined. for example, a person's gender, preferred newspaper, frequency of television viewing, or their highest level of education. So whenever you want to test whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables, you use a Chi2 test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of the Chi-Square Test\n",
    "There are various applications of the Chi-square test, it can be used to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Independence test\n",
    "Are two categorical variables independent of each other? For example, does gender have an impact on whether a person has a Netflix subscription or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Distribution test\n",
    "Are the observed values of two categorical variables equal to the expected values? One question could be, is one of the three video streaming services Netflix, Amazon, and Disney subscribed to above average?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Homogeneity test\n",
    "Are two or more samples from the same population? One question could be whether the subscription frequencies of the three video streaming services Netflix, Amazon and Disney differ in different age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate chi-squared\n",
    "The chi-squared value is calculated via:\n",
    "χ2 =∑(Oi −Ei)2 / Ei\n",
    "After calculating chi-squared the number of degrees of freedom df is needed. This is given by\n",

    "r: number of lines\n",
    "c: number of columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-Square Test of Independence\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test of Independence is used when two categorical variables are to be tested for independence. The aim is to analyze whether the characteristic values of the first variable are influenced by the characteristic values of the second variable and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, does gender have an influence on whether a person has a Netflix subscription or not? For the two variables gender (male, female) and has Netflix subscription (yes, no), it is tested whether they are independent. If this is not the case, there is a relationship between the characteristics.\n",
    "f(i, j) = RowSum(i) . ColumnSum(j) / N\n",
    "where i and j are the rows and columns of the table respectively\n",

    "Chi-square distribution test\n",
    "If a variable is present with two or more values, the differences in the frequency of the individual values can be examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-square distribution test, or Goodness-of-fit test, checks whether the frequencies of the individual characteristic values in the sample correspond to the frequencies of a defined distribution. In most cases, this defined distribution corresponds to that of the population. In this case, it is tested whether the sample comes from the respective population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square homogeneity test\n",
    "The Chi-square homogeneity test can be used to check whether two or more samples come from the same population? Example could be whether the subscription frequency of three video streaming services Netflix, Amazon and Disney differ in different age groups.\n",

    "What Is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)?\n",
    "Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method for determining whether differences in group means are statistically significant or likely due to random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a statistical test used to assess the difference between the means of more than two groups. At its core, ANOVA allows you to compare arithmetic means across groups simultaneously. You can determine whether the differences observed are due to random chance or if they reflect genuine, meaningful differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-way ANOVA uses one independent variable. A two-way ANOVA uses two independent variables. Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable in a regression study.\n",

By comparing means and partitioning variance, ANOVA provides a robust way to understand the relationships between variables and identify significant differences among groups.\n",

    "### Two Tailed Tests\n",
    "```c\n",
    "A two-tailed test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this type of test, the critical region for rejection of the null hypothesis is divided between both tails of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Basics of Two-Tailed Tests\n",
    "To understand two-tailed tests, it's crucial to appreciate the underlying hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H0) posits that there is no effect or difference, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is an effect or difference that exists in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directional approach is what distinguishes a two-tailed test from one-tailed tests, where the critical region is located in only one tail of the distribution. Consequently, two-tailed tests offer a comprehensive look at data, allowing researchers to identify deviations in both directions. This is particularly useful in fields such as psychology and medicine, where unexpected results can provide valuable insights into complex phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive Analysis: They allow for the detection of differences in both directions, providing a more thorough understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Approach: In many scenarios, two-tailed tests are treated as the standard procedure unless specified otherwise, simplifying analysis protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing Type I Errors: By equally distributing the critical regions, two-tailed tests can reduce the risk of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, two-tailed tests represent a critical component of statistical analysis, providing researchers and analysts with the tools needed to dissect and understand their data comprehensively.\n",

    "Analyze and selecting your categorical features for creating a prediction model\n",

    "\n",
    "In our everyday data science work, we often encounter categorical features. Some people would be confused about how to handle these features, especially when we want to create a prediction model where those models basically an equation that accepting number; not a category.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to encode all the category variable using the OneHotEncoding method (encode all the categorical class into numerical values 0 and 1, where 0 mean absent and 1 is present).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of One Hot Encoding method\n",
    "Example of One Hot Encoding method\n",
    "This method is preferable by many as the information is still present and it is easy to understand the concept. The downfall is when we possess many categorical features with high cardinality, the number of the features after OneHotEncoding process would be massive. Why we do not want a lot of features in our training dataset? it is because of the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While adding features could decrease the error in our prediction model, it would only decrease until a certain number of features; after that, the error will increase again. This is the concept of the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ways to alleviate this problem, but one of my to-go techniques is by doing feature selection via the Chi-Square test of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-Square Test of Independence\n",
    "The Chi-Square test of independence is used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two categorical (nominal) variables. It means the Chi-Square Test of Independence is a hypothesis testing test with 2 hypotheses present; the Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis. The hypothesis is written below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a relationship between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any statistical testing, we test it against our chosen p-value (often it is 0.05). If the p-value is significant, we can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternative hypothesis. I would not dwell much into the statistic theory, as the purpose of this article is to show how the feature selection using the Chi-Square test is works for practical use.\n",
    "\n",

If we have multiple classes within a category, we would not be able to easily tell which class of the features are responsible for the relationship if the Chi-square table is larger than 2×2. To pinpoint which class is responsible, we need a post hoc test.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct multiple 2×2 Chi-square test of independence, we need to regroup the features for each test to where it is one category class against the rest. To do this, we could apply OneHotEncoding to each class and create a new cross-tab table against the other feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s try to do a post hoc test to the Property_Area feature. First, we need to done OneHotEncoding to the Property_Area feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "We then could do a Chi-Square test of independence to this pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is something to remember. Comparing multiple classes against each other would means that the error rate of a false positive compound with each test. For example, if we choose our first test at p-value level 0.05 means there is a 5% chance of a false positive; if we have multiple classes, the test after that would compounding the error with the chance become 10% of a false positive, and so forth. With each subsequent test, the error rate would increase by 5%. In our case above, we had 3 pairwise comparisons. This means that our Chi-square test would have an error rate of 15%. Meaning our p-value being tested at would equal 0.15, which is quite high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we could use the Bonferroni-adjusted method for correcting the p-value we use. We adjust our P-value by the number of pairwise comparisons we want to do. The formula is p/N, where p= the p-value of the original test and N= the number of planned pairwise comparisons. For example, in our case, above we have 3 class within the Property_Area feature; which means we would have 3 pairwise comparisons if we test all the class against the Loan_Status feature. Our P-value would be 0.05/3 = 0.0167\n",

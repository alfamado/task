    "### Question 1: Class Test Scores\n",
    "The following are the Mathematics test scores (out of 20) for a class of 15 students: 5, 8, 10, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 18, 18, 20, 20\n",
    "    a) Find the mean, median, and mode of the scores.\n",
    "    b) If the lowest score (5) was wrongly recorded and should have been 10, how would the mean change? Would the median or mode change? Explain.\n",

    "B) If the lowest score should have been 10 instead of 5, then there's going to be a difference in the mean. calculation for new mean is\n",
